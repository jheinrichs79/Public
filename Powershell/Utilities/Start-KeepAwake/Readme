This utility was based off other code I found on the internet. Almost none of the examples had a feature to preset the amount of time you want the application to run.

If you double click the file, the application will ask you how many hours you want it to run for.
If you run the program from the command line or batch file you can pre-enter how long you want the program to run at run time, that way you don't get asked when run.

Examples:

  # 1.) Keep awake for 1hr
  ==========================================
  Start-KeepAwake.exe -hours 1
  
  # 2.) Keep awake for 30 minutes
  ==========================================
  Start-KeepAwake.exe -hours .5
  
  # 3.) Keep awake for 7hrs and 15 minutes
  ==========================================
  Start-KeepAwake.exe -hours 7.25
